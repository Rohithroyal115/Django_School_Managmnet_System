# Django_School_Management_System
The School Management System is a comprehensive web-based application developed using Django that streamlines and automates the academic and administrative operations of an educational institute. The project implements secure authentication and authorization using Django’s built-in authentication framework, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the system and that functionalities are strictly controlled based on user roles such as Admin, Teacher, and Student. Each role has clearly defined permissions, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.

The system includes a fully integrated Fee Payment Module that allows students to pay their academic fees online through a payment gateway (such as Razorpay or Stripe). This module ensures secure transaction processing, maintains detailed payment records, and updates fee status automatically upon successful payment. Administrators can track payment history, verify transactions, and generate fee-related reports, which significantly reduces manual bookkeeping and errors.

In addition to payments, the application provides robust academic and administrative modules. The Admin Module enables complete management of students, teachers, courses, and subjects, along with assigning teachers to specific courses and monitoring overall institutional activities. The Teacher Module allows faculty members to securely log in, view their assigned subjects, upload lecture materials and notes, manage student-related academic information, and support classroom activities. The Student Module provides students with access to their enrolled courses, available study materials, notices, and fee payment details, creating a transparent and user-friendly academic experience.

The project also features course and subject management, announcement and notice handling, and record management for students and payments. Security measures such as password hashing, session management, and CSRF protection are implemented to ensure data integrity and system reliability. Overall, this project demonstrates a scalable, secure, and real-world-ready solution for managing institutional workflows efficiently, making it suitable for colleges, training institutes, and educational organizations.
